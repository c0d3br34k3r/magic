Heart of Bogardan {2}{R}{R}
Enchantment
Cumulative upkeep {2} (At the beginning of your upkeep, put an age counter on this permanent, then sacrifice it unless you pay its upkeep cost for each age counter on it.)
When a player doesn't pay Heart of Bogardan's cumulative upkeep, Heart of Bogardan deals X damage to target player and each creature he or she controls, where X is twice the number of age counters on Heart of Bogardan minus 2.
