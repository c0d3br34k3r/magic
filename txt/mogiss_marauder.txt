Mogis's Marauder {2}{B}
Creature â€” Human Berserker
When Mogis's Marauder enters the battlefield, up to X target creatures each gain intimidate and haste until end of turn, where X is your devotion to black. (A creature with intimidate can't be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or creatures that share a color with it. Each {B} in the mana costs of permanents you control counts toward your devotion to black.)
