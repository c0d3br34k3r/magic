Kaboom! {4}{R}
Sorcery
Choose any number of target players. For each of those players, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a nonland card. Kaboom! deals damage equal to that card's converted mana cost to that player, then you put the revealed cards on the bottom of your library in any order.
