Soraya the Falconer {1}{W}{W}
Legendary Creature â€” Human
Bird creatures get +1/+1.
{1}{W}: Target Bird creature gains banding until end of turn. (Any creatures with banding, and up to one without, can attack in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If any creatures with banding a player controls are blocking or being blocked by a creature, that player divides that creature's combat damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked by or is blocking.)
