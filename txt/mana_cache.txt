Mana Cache {1}{R}{R}
Enchantment
At the beginning of each player's end step, put a charge counter on Mana Cache for each untapped land that player controls.
Remove a charge counter from Mana Cache: Add {C} to your mana pool. Any player may activate this ability but only during his or her turn before the end step.
