Twinflame {1}{R}
Sorcery
Strive â€” Twinflame costs {2}{R} more to cast for each target beyond the first.
Choose any number of target creatures you control. For each of them, put a token that's a copy of that creature onto the battlefield. Those tokens have haste. Exile them at the beginning of the next end step.
