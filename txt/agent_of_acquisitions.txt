Agent of Acquisitions {2}
Artifact Creature â€” Construct
Draft Agent of Acquisitions face up.
Instead of drafting a card from a booster pack, you may draft each card in that booster pack, one at a time. If you do, turn Agent of Acquisitions face down and you can't draft cards for the rest of this draft round. (You may look at booster packs passed to you.)
