Pygmy Hippo {U}{G}
Creature â€” Hippo
Whenever Pygmy Hippo attacks and isn't blocked, you may have defending player activate a mana ability of each land he or she controls and empty his or her mana pool. If you do, Pygmy Hippo assigns no combat damage this turn and at the beginning of your next main phase this turn, you add an amount of {C} to your mana pool equal to the amount of mana emptied from that player's mana pool this way.
