Acolyte's Reward {1}{W}
Instant
Prevent the next X damage that would be dealt to target creature this turn, where X is your devotion to white. If damage is prevented this way, Acolyte's Reward deals that much damage to target creature or player. (Each {W} in the mana costs of permanents you control counts toward your devotion to white.)
