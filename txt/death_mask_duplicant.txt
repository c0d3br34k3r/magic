Death-Mask Duplicant {7}
Artifact Creature — Shapeshifter
Imprint — {1}: Exile target creature card from your graveyard.
As long as a card exiled with Death-Mask Duplicant has flying, Death-Mask Duplicant has flying. The same is true for fear, first strike, double strike, haste, landwalk, protection, and trample.
5/5
