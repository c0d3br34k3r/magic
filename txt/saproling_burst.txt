Saproling Burst {4}{G}
Enchantment
Fading 7 (This enchantment enters the battlefield with seven fade counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from it. If you can't, sacrifice it.)
Remove a fade counter from Saproling Burst: Put a green Saproling creature token onto the battlefield. It has "This creature's power and toughness are each equal to the number of fade counters on Saproling Burst."
When Saproling Burst leaves the battlefield, destroy all tokens put onto the battlefield with Saproling Burst. They can't be regenerated.
