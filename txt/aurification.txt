Aurification {2}{W}{W}
Enchantment
Whenever a creature deals damage to you, put a gold counter on it.
Each creature with a gold counter on it is a Wall in addition to its other creature types and has defender. (Those creatures can't attack.)
When Aurification leaves the battlefield, remove all gold counters from all creatures.
