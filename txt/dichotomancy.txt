Dichotomancy {7}{U}{U}
Sorcery
For each tapped nonland permanent target opponent controls, search that player's library for a card with the same name as that permanent and put it onto the battlefield under your control. Then that player shuffles his or her library.
Suspend 3â€”{1}{U}{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{U}{U} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)
