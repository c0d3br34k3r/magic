War Barge {4}
Artifact
{3}: Target creature gains islandwalk until end of turn. When War Barge leaves the battlefield this turn, destroy that creature. A creature destroyed this way can't be regenerated. (A creature with islandwalk can't be blocked as long as defending player controls an Island.)
