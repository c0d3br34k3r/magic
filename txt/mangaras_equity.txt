Mangara's Equity {1}{W}{W}
Enchantment
As Mangara's Equity enters the battlefield, choose black or red.
At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice Mangara's Equity unless you pay {1}{W}.
Whenever a creature of the chosen color deals damage to you or a white creature you control, Mangara's Equity deals that much damage to that creature.
