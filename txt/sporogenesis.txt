Sporogenesis {3}{G}
Enchantment
At the beginning of your upkeep, you may put a fungus counter on target nontoken creature.
Whenever a creature with a fungus counter on it dies, put a 1/1 green Saproling creature token onto the battlefield for each fungus counter on that creature.
When Sporogenesis leaves the battlefield, remove all fungus counters from all creatures.
