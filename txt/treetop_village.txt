Treetop Village
Land
Treetop Village enters the battlefield tapped.
{T}: Add {G} to your mana pool.
{1}{G}: Treetop Village becomes a 3/3 green Ape creature with trample until end of turn. It's still a land. (If it would assign enough damage to its blockers to destroy them, you may have it assign the rest of its damage to defending player or planeswalker.)
