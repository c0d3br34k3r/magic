Cairn Wanderer {4}{B}
Creature â€” Shapeshifter
Changeling (This card is every creature type.)
As long as a creature card with flying is in a graveyard, Cairn Wanderer has flying. The same is true for fear, first strike, double strike, deathtouch, haste, landwalk, lifelink, protection, reach, trample, shroud, and vigilance.
