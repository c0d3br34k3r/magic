Dark Dabbling {2}{B}
Instant
Regenerate target creature. Draw a card. (The next time the creature would be destroyed this turn, it isn't. Instead tap it, remove all damage from it, and remove it from combat.)
Spell mastery â€” If there are two or more instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard, also regenerate each other creature you control.
