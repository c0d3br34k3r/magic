Nantuko Shaman {2}{G}
Creature — Insect Shaman
When Nantuko Shaman enters the battlefield, if you control no tapped lands, draw a card.
Suspend 1—{2}{G}{G} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{G}{G} and exile it with a time counter on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
3/2
