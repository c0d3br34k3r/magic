Shining Shoal {X}{W}{W}
Instant â€” Arcane
You may exile a white card with converted mana cost X from your hand rather than pay Shining Shoal's mana cost.
The next X damage that a source of your choice would deal to you and/or creatures you control this turn is dealt to target creature or player instead.
