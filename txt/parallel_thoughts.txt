Parallel Thoughts {3}{U}{U}
Enchantment
When Parallel Thoughts enters the battlefield, search your library for seven cards, exile them in a face-down pile, and shuffle that pile. Then shuffle your library.
If you would draw a card, you may instead put the top card of the pile you exiled into your hand.
