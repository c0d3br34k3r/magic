Touch of Moonglove {B}
Instant
Target creature you control gets +1/+0 and gains deathtouch until end of turn. Whenever a creature dealt damage by that creature dies this turn, its controller loses 2 life. (Any amount of damage a creature with deathtouch deals to a creature is enough to destroy it.)
