Nihilith {4}{B}{B}
Creature — Horror
Fear (This creature can't be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or black creatures.)
Suspend 7—{1}{B} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{B} and exile it with seven time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
Whenever a card is put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, if Nihilith is suspended, you may remove a time counter from Nihilith.
4/4
