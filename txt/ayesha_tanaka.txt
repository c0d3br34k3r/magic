If any creatures with banding you control are blocking or being blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked by or is blocking.)
{T}: Counter target activated ability from an artifact source unless that ability's controller pays {W}. (Mana abilities can't be targeted.)
