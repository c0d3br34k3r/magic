Jeskai Infiltrator {2}{U}
Creature â€” Human Monk
Jeskai Infiltrator can't be blocked as long as you control no other creatures.
When Jeskai Infiltrator deals combat damage to a player, exile it and the top card of your library in a face-down pile, shuffle that pile, then manifest those cards. (To manifest a card, put it onto the battlefield face down as a 2/2 creature. Turn it face up any time for its mana cost if it's a creature card.)
2/3
