Mangara's Tome {5}
Artifact
When Mangara's Tome enters the battlefield, search your library for five cards, exile them in a face-down pile, and shuffle that pile. Then shuffle your library.
{2}: The next time you would draw a card this turn, instead put the top card of the exiled pile into its owner's hand.
